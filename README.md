# LabVIEW
This repository contains LabVIEW code developed for the characterisation of micromotion at the bone-implant interface after total knee replacement. This work was conducted as part of my PhD studies at the Universit of Edinburgh. Further details can be found at:

This code is provided as is and is free to use/modify. However, we ask that proper reference/citation be given if you use all or part of our code in the preparation of grants, journal papers or other technical manuscripts/publications.
